Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/memory-meme-game)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [-https://www.w3schools.com/]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [A challenge that I encountered in creating this submission was getting used to the programming languages. I'm familiar with coding in HTML and CSS, but
   it has been a year or two since I last coded with the languages, so it took me a bit to get back into the swing of things. I wasn't as familiar with Javascript
   as I was with the other two languages, but overall I was able to find resources to help me better understanding certain concepts and ideas in terms of
   successfully building my game. Sometimes, what I tried in my code did not work until after a few tries. For example, creating a function to utilize a new pattern
   every time the user begins the game was a challenge and took many attempts. Ultimately, I used the website listed above to implement the Math.number function into my code. Overall,
   some parts of this project were challenging; however, it was great to be able to find ways to be creative while demonstrating my passion for programming.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [I'd love to know more about game development and how to create better graphics and animations through web development specifically. Even though this is a simple pattern game,
   I've always been intriguied to learn about the algorithms and systems that are in place of popular web games, such as Angry Birds and Poptropica. It also raises some
   questions as to how web developers implement cybersecurity concepts into their work to make sure that if a user inputs any information (i.e logging into an account), their
   personal information is kept safe. I would also love to know more about displaying animations on web pages.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would develop a better interface. I would have loved to create a main menu to link to other games and maybe even some more animations. I think it's important
   to be able to have an entizing design for your audience and to be creative with the overall design. It shows professionalism and increases the chances of the player to return to the game and maybe even recommend
   it to friends. It would have been fun for me to develop a way for the player to create an avatar and customize is as they please. Another feature I would have liked to implement would be varying levels of difficulties
   along with a reward system. If the player completed a level, they would receive a certain number of coins. The more difficult the level is, the more coins the player would receive. How I would have designed it would be
   that those coins could be used to obtain prizes, like an outfit for their avatar or maybe an extra life in the game.]
